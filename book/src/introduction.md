# Introduction

Typhoon is a high-performance Solana Sealevel Framework designed for developers who need maximum efficiency and control. Built on top of `pinocchio`, Typhoon provides a thin abstraction layer that simplifies program development while maintaining a `no-std` environment and zero-cost abstractions.

## Why Typhoon?

Traditional frameworks can often introduce significant overhead in terms of binary size and compute units. Typhoon addresses this by:

- **Minimal Abstractions**: Only what you need to build robust programs.
- **High Performance**: Optimized for the Solana VM.
- **No-Std by Default**: Ensuring compatibility with the most constrained environments.
- **Procedural Macros**: Simplifying boilerplate with powerful macros like `#[context]` and `basic_router!`.
