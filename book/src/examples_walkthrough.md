# Examples Walkthrough

Typhoon includes several examples to help you understand how to build real-world programs. You can find them in the `examples/` directory.

## Core Examples

### [Hello World](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/hello-world)
A minimal example showing the basic structure of a Typhoon program. Covered in [Getting Started](./getting_started.md).

### [Counter](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/counter)
Demonstrates how to maintain state in an account and increment a counter.

### [Transfer SOL](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/transfer-sol)
Shows how to handle SOL transfers between accounts.

## Advanced Examples

### [Escrow](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/escrow)
A more complex example involving multiple accounts, state transitions, and token transfers.

### [CPI (Cross-Program Invocation)](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/cpi)
Demonstrates how to call other programs from within a Typhoon program.

### [Anchor CPI](file:///home/aursen/Documents/Rust/typhoon/examples/anchor-cpi)
Shows how Typhoon can interact with programs built using the Anchor framework.

Each example is designed to be self-contained and demonstrates a specific feature or pattern of the Typhoon framework.
